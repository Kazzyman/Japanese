Finish composing hint content (one specific line of each card should contain no Romaji)

We will probably never want to be prompted with Hiragana chars, ever! Because, that would just be too easy??? ...
... It is more useful to only see a Katakana or Romaji prompt, so we would only ever want a Hiragana hint.
//
But, when being prompted to enter Romaji from a Katakana prompt we would like a hint sans the KeyR ...
... which is to say: just a naked aCard.KeyH or aCard.Value is what we want (ONLY a Hiragana char as hint)
... that, and|or maybe just one dedicated line from the hints lines, i.e., aCard.Hint-x

Develop a method for deploying hints for romaji prompts using just-one of the four aCard hint fields
... Finish hints fields in main char struct (one line must be reserved for romaji hints)

? Eventually, delete unused files hint4kata.go(noUsages); and singleQuestionMarksHints.go, after salvaging hints etc.

Try refining drill lines in fifth activity, Kata, Hira, and Romaji (respond to each with Hiragana)

Start adding actual Japanese words (with Kanji) to the menus etc. Then ...
... Create a struct, a file-of-cards, with kanji chars, both words and phrases, to implement an activity similar to 1-4

/*
Romaji_Prompt
Romaji+Kata_Prompt
Kata_Prompt-Respond-w-Hira|Romaji
*/

/*
Chars from the blue card: 46+15+25+21=107 : if we include all the suffixed combination "chars".
... 46*2=92 would be the total for the complete simple hiragana+katakana set; of base chars.
 ... doubling it all (the 107 from above) for katakana gives a grand total of 214 Japanese chars excluding the various punctuation characters.
