Develop a method for deploying hints for romaji prompts using just-one of the four aCard hint fields
... Finish hints fields in main char struct (one line must be reserved for romaji hints)

? Eventually, delete unused files hint4kata.go(noUsages); and singleQuestionMarksHints.go, after salvaging hints etc.

Try refining drill lines in fifth activity, Kata, Hira, and Romaji (respond to each with Hiragana)

Start adding actual Japanese words (with Kanji) to the menus etc.

Create a struct, a file-of-cards, with kanji chars, both words and phrases, to implement an activity similar to 1-4

/*
Romaji_Prompt
Romaji+Kata_Prompt
Kata_Prompt-Respond-w-Hira|Romaji
*/

/*
Chars from the blue card: 46+15+25+21=107 : if we include all the suffixed combination "chars".
... 46*2=92 would be the total for the complete simple hiragana+katakana set; of base chars.
 ... doubling it all (the 107 from above) for katakana gives a grand total of 214 Japanese chars excluding the various punctuation characters.
