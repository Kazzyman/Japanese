? make a directive to show the non-empty elements of the fineOn array ?

Finish details of ...
... logging to a file all occurrences of when interventions were applied to the random card picks etc.
Read the stats file, maybe condense/accumulate the events : load a map with each occurrence and then show the map
add date and time to each session

Add Japanese words (with Kanji) to the menus etc. Then ...
... Create a struct, a file-of-cards, with kanji chars, both words and phrases, to implement an activity similar to 1-4

Finish composing hint content in data.go:
... note:
... we will probably never want to be prompted with Hiragana chars, ever! Because, that would just be too easy ...
... it is more useful to only see a Katakana or Romaji prompt, so we would only ever want a 'Hiragana hint'.

Try refining drill lines in fifth activity, Kata, Hira, and Romaji (respond to each with Hiragana)

/*
Chars from the blue card: 46+15+25+21=107 : if we include all the suffixed combination "chars".
... 46*2=92 would be the total for the complete simple hiragana+katakana set; of base chars.
 ... doubling it all (the 107 from above) for katakana gives a grand total of 214 Japanese chars excluding the various punctuation characters.
